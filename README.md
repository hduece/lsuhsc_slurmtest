1. Download the two code files in this repository to your computer. These will be our first SLURM job.
2. Request your account and make sure you can login to the Tigerfish cluster, as described [here.](https://www.lsuhsc.edu/admin/it/hpc/information.aspx)
3. We need to get our two files from your computer to the cluster. Either use cd to navigate to their directory and use this command:
>scp test.py first_job.slurm [username]@tigerfish.lsuhsc.edu

*Inspiration for this first SLURM job walkthrough taken from Princeton University's similar guide, HPC beginning workshop, which is located [here.](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/hpc_beginning_workshop)*
