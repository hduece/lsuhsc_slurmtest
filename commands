Some useful commands for working through the command line:
  ls                                          # shows you what exists in the folder you are currently in
  dir                                         # ls for Windows
  cd                                          # moves you into a folder (cluster and windows)
  scp /origin/file /destination/location      # to move files between cluster and computer
  ssh username@tigerfish.lsuhsc.edu           # connects you to the cluster from your command line. Must be on campus or using LSUHSC's VPN
  mv file /destination                        # moves a file to the folder you specify. Can also be used to rename files if your “destination” is the new name you want.  
  sbatch file.slurm                           # runs the slurm file
  squeue                                      # shows all currently running jobs on the cluster
  cat filename.extension                      # opens the file for you to look at
  slurm-number.out                            # your output files
  scancel jobid                               # cancels the specified job
